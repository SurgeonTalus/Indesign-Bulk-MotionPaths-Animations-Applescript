# Indesign Bulk MotionPaths Animations AppleScript

![Animation Example](https://github.com/SurgeonTalus/Indesign-Bulk-MotionPaths-Animations-Applescript/blob/main/BulkAnimation%20Indesign.png)

## Introduction  
This AppleScript allows you to bulk apply motion paths and animations to objects in **Adobe InDesign**. The script helps save time and effort when working with complex designs requiring multiple animations.

## Use Cases  
- Apply animations to multiple objects across multiple pages in a single document.  
- Create consistent animation effects throughout a large document.  
- Automate the process of applying animations to individual objects, saving valuable time.  

## How It Works  
1. The script prompts the user to select an animation preset from a list of predefined options.  
2. It applies the selected animation preset to the **second object** on each page (or the **first object** if there is only one).  
3. The user is prompted to confirm whether to proceed to the next page or cancel the script.  

## Potential Bugs and Limitations  
- The script **only applies** the animation preset to the second object on each page (or the first if there's only one). If you need to target a different object, the script must be modified.  
- Uses a **hardcoded** list of animation presets. Custom presets require script modification.  
- Limited **error handling**â€”if an error occurs, the script may not recover correctly.  

## Future Improvements  
- Add more animation presets.  
- Allow users to select which object receives the animation.  
- Improve error handling for better script stability.  
- Support **multiple** animation effects per object.  

## Example Use Case  
Suppose you have a **10-page** document with multiple objects on each page, and you want to apply a consistent animation effect to the **second object** on each page. Using this script, you can select the `"fly-in-left"` animation preset and apply it efficiently.  


## Script Code  
```applescript
-- List of animation presets
set presetList to {"appear", "fly-in-left", "fly-in-right", "fly-in-top", "fly-in-bottom", 
"fade-in", "grow", "twirl", "wipe", "bounce", "swivel", "scale", "flip", "spin"}

# ðŸ“Œ Modifying the AppleScript for Page and Item Selection

This guide explains how to modify the script to **target specific pages** and **apply animations to different objects**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Changing the Starting Page  

By default, the script starts from **page 1**. To start from a different page, modify this line:

```applescript
set currentPageIndex to 1 -- Change this to start from a different page

For example, to start from page 3, change it to:

set currentPageIndex to 3
```

ðŸ”¹ Changing the Target Object on Each Page

By default, the script applies the animation to the second item on each page.
To modify which object gets animated, update these lines:
```applescript
if (count of page items of targetPage) > 1 then
    set selectedItem to item 2 of page items of targetPage -- Change '2' to desired object number
else
    set selectedItem to item 1 of page items of targetPage
end if
```
âœ… Example: Applying animation to the 3rd object on each page:
```applescript
if (count of page items of targetPage) > 2 then
    set selectedItem to item 3 of page items of targetPage
else
    set selectedItem to item 1 of page items of targetPage
end if
```
This ensures that if there are at least 3 objects on the page, the third one gets animated. Otherwise, the first available object is selected.

## Applying the Animation to All Objects on a Page

If you want to apply the animation to all objects on a page, replace:
```applescript
set selectedItem to item 2 of page items of targetPage
```
with:
```applescript
repeat with selectedItem in page items of targetPage
    tell animation settings of selectedItem
        set preset to selectedPreset
    end tell
end repeat
```
This loops through all objects on the page and applies the animation.

## Applying the Animation to a Specific Page Range

To apply animations only to a specific set of pages, replace:
```applescript
repeat

with:

repeat with currentPageIndex from 2 to 5 -- Change 2 and 5 to your desired page range
```
This ensures the script only applies animations from page 2 to page 5.
## Summary of Changes You Can Make

Change	How to Modify
Start from a specific page	Change set currentPageIndex to X
Apply animation to a different object	Change set selectedItem to item X of page items of targetPage
Animate all objects on a page	Use repeat with selectedItem in page items of targetPage
Apply animation to a page range	Use repeat with currentPageIndex from X to Y

Now you can customize the script as per your needs! ðŸš€
